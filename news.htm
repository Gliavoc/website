<h2>After a Year Break</h2>
<p id = "post">
After a year of working a job instead of going to school, I am glad to be back into college. 
COVID-19 affected my life, but I won't let it stop me from making myself a future. 
I am planning to join the Object Oriented Design club at my school, and to become a Computer Science Pre-Major this quarter.
